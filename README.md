# Bioinformatics-based polypharmacology workflow

This repository contains Python scripts to start a workflow for computational prediction of binding pocket similarities using <a href="https://github.com/1337deepesh/PocketMatch_v2.0">PocketMatch 2.0</a>
between protein structures of a list of genes provided as input.

The scripts should be run in the order given below. 

The operations performed by each of them are described below:

1. **get_uniprot_data.py** reads gene names from a file, performs UniProt queries to retrieve gene data, saves the data to a CSV file.
2. **get_pdb_af.py:** TO-DO
3. **fix_pdb.py:** TO-DO
4. **get_pockets.py:** TO-DO
