# Bioinformatics-based polypharmacology workflow

This repository contains Python scripts to start a workflow for computational prediction of binding pocket similarities using PocketMatch 2.0 
between protein structures of a list of genes provided as input.

The scripts should be run in the given order. 

The operations performed by each of them are described below:

1. **get_uniprot_data.py:**
2. **get_pdb_af.py:**
3. **fix_pdb.py:**
4. **get_pockets.py:**
